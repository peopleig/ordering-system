## Introduction  
This is a website to serve as a Food Ordering Management System.  
It will offer customers a quick way to browse through the menu and ordering food without any hassle.  
The website also contains a chef-side portal, providing the chefs to efficiently track the orders and dividing the work between themselves.  
A third portal is for the admin, allowing maximum customisability, helping create an individual identity for each restaurant. Add new dishes, remove old ones, custom discounts, a customer reward scheme and much more.
